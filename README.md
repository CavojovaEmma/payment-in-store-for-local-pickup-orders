SUPPORT | UPDATES | CONTRIBUTIONS
-----------------------------

If you're using my program, I would **really appreciate any suggestions or feedback** you have. If you resolve an issue, fix a bug, or add a new feature, please share it with me or submit a pull request. (That said, I’m not obligated to follow every suggestion or implement all changes.)
My **updates are sporadic**, as I only work on the program when I encounter a bug or when the current version no longer meets my needs.
**I don't offer support**. This program was created for my own use—for fun, in my free time, and for free. It’s not guaranteed to work for everyone. That doesn’t mean I’m unwilling to help, though.
While I test my code thoroughly, I can't cover every possible scenario. Most issues can likely be resolved with a quick Google search. That’s what I do when I encounter problems with other plugins or tools I use.
